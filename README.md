# API-project

The purpose of this project is to practice using API's. In this project I use the NY Times API and the Twitter API. 
It uses the NY Times API in order to find the most viewed, emailed, and shared article on the NY Times website.
Using a simple menu, the user can select their time range and view the title, author, publishing date, and tags for the selected articles.
The last option the user has is to search Twitter with the tags from the NY Times articles in order to get a list of tweets. The program
will then compare the content of the tweets to the positive and negative word lists in order to calculate an emotional score of each tag.
